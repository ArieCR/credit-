# 1. way forward 
Incremental Roadmap

  - v0: enter raw mode, read keys, print their codes, exit cleanly.
  - v1: clear screen, draw tildes; handle window size and resize.
  - v2: open file, display lines; arrow movement; scrolling.
  - v3: insert, delete, newline; dirty flag; save to file.
  - v4: status/message bar, simple prompt line.
  - v5: search; syntax highlight for one language.
  - v6: line numbers, basic config (tab stop, soft wrap off).
